# Authorization Changes Documentation: OPERATOR Role for Quizzes

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to include the OPERATOR role in the authorization logic for all organizer quiz-related API routes and pages. Previously, only users with the ADMIN role could access and manage quizzes. Now, users with either ADMIN or OPERATOR roles can access these features.

## Authorization Utilities Created

### Quiz Authorization Utility

Created a centralized authorization utility in `/src/app/api/organizer/quizzes/auth-utils.ts` that:
- Verifies if the user is authenticated
- Checks if the user is not a participant
- Ensures the user has either ADMIN or OPERATOR role
- Returns a standardized response object with authorization result

### Question Authorization Utility

Created a similar authorization utility in `/src/app/api/organizer/questions/auth-utils.ts` for question-related API routes.

## API Routes Updated

The following API routes were updated to use the centralized authorization utilities:

1. **Main Quiz API Routes**
   - `/src/app/api/organizer/quizzes/[id]/route.ts` (GET, PUT, DELETE methods)

2. **Quiz Publication API Routes**
   - `/src/app/api/organizer/quizzes/[id]/publish/route.ts` (POST, PATCH methods)

3. **Quiz Questions API Routes**
   - `/src/app/api/organizer/quizzes/[id]/questions/route.ts` (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods)
   
4. **Quiz Results API Route**
   - `/src/app/api/organizer/quizzes/[id]/results/route.ts` (GET method)

5. **Questions API Route**
   - `/src/app/api/organizer/questions/route.ts` (GET, POST methods)

## Frontend Pages

The frontend pages for quiz management don't contain explicit role checks that would block OPERATOR access. Since the API routes have been updated to accept OPERATOR roles, these users will now have proper access to all quiz management features.

## Testing

Created a test script at `/Users/azham/a-job/repo/mt25/test-quiz-auth.js` to verify that users with the OPERATOR role can access quiz-related API endpoints. The script tests:
- Main quizzes list endpoint
- Single quiz details endpoint
- Quiz questions endpoint
- Quiz results endpoint

## Implementation Pattern

For each API route, the implementation follows this pattern:
1. Retrieve the current user with `getCurrentUser()`
2. Check authorization with the appropriate utility function
3. Return error response if not authorized
4. Proceed with the requested operation if authorized

Example:
```typescript
export async function GET(
  request: NextRequest,
  { params }: { params: { id: string } }
) {
  try {
    const user = await getCurrentUser();
    const authCheck = await checkQuizAuthorization(user);
    
    if (!authCheck.authorized) {
      return authCheck.response;
    }
    
    // Continue with authorized operation...
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling...
  }
}
```

## Benefits

- **Consistent authorization logic**: Using centralized utilities ensures consistent role checking across all endpoints
- **Improved maintainability**: Changes to authorization rules can be made in a single location
- **Better security**: Proper authorization checks are applied uniformly
- **Role expansion**: OPERATOR users now have the same quiz management capabilities as ADMIN users

## Next Steps

To fully validate these changes, the following should be performed:
1. Test with real OPERATOR role user accounts in staging/testing environment
2. Monitor for any authorization-related issues in production
3. Update documentation for organizers to clarify that OPERATOR users now have quiz management capabilities
